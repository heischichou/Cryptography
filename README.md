# Cryptography
This is a compilation/personal library of all the codes for the ciphers and cryptographic algorithms I have learned throughout my college course IT 3104N - Information Assurance and Security.

## Setup
To test a header file, add the following code to the beginning of file of the driver program main.c:
```c
#include "./{FOLDER NAME}/{HEADER FILE NAME}.h"

Example:
#include "./Atbash Cipher/Atbash_Cipher.h"
```
